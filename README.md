## How the file works

Each myth is a JSON object with these keys (in this order):

```json
{
  "title": "Short label",
  "myth": "The wrong idea people have",
  "rebuttalPro": "Longer explanation (use \\n for new lines)",
  "eli5": "Two-sentence kid-friendly summary",
  "references": [
    { "title": "Source name", "url": "https://example.com" }
  ]
}
